Requirements
============

dnf-repo needs to be a build of the dnf module (via. mbs-build local is fine).

Building
========

Run "make" for help.
Running make build should build an image, and make run should run it.

Result
======

The built image is available from: docker pull jamesantill/flat-modules-dnf
